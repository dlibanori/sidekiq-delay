Wouldn't be nice if you could easily queue model method calls to Sidekiq? With **Sidekiq::Delay** you can!

You have just to include a module and call `delay` before any method call. Actually, your model class have to respond to some methods, but if you are using `ActiveRecord` or `Mongoid` they already do.

**NOTE**: It doesn't support `block` arguments.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sidekiq-delay'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sidekiq-delay

## Usage

First you have to include `Sidekiq::Delay` at your model.

```ruby
  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Sidekiq::Delay

    field :name

    def play!
      # a long task
      sleep 3
    end
  end
```

Now you can `delay` method calls to a Sidekiq queue.

```ruby
  band = Band.create(name: 'Daft Punk')
  band.delay.play!
```

## How it works

It queues a job with model class, model id, method name and args. Later, at Sidekiq, it finds your model using `class` and `id` and calls method with args. Your class must respond to `find(id)` and return same model.

**NOTE**: Your model must be stored at database before `delay` any call.

## Custom works

What if you class doesn't respond to `find` or you want to use another `Sidekiq` plugin? You can easily write a **custom worker**. You have just to set your model to use it with `worker` method.

Your worker just need to include `Sidekiq::Delay::Strategy` or extend `Sidekiq::Delay::Worker`.

```ruby
  class TeamWorker
    include Sidekiq::Worker
    include Sidekiq::Delay::Strategy

    def record(klass, id)
      klass.custom_find(id)
    end
  end

  class Team
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Sidekiq::Delay

    worker TeamWorker

    field :name

    def self.custom_find(id)
      find(id)
    end

    def play!
      # a long task
      sleep 3
    end
  end
```
